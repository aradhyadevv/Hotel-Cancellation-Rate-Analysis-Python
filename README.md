#### Resources: .ipynb jupyter file and csv data attached in  repository
### Problem Statement

High cancellation rates in hotel bookings can significantly impact revenue and operational efficiency. By investigating a dataset of 120,000 hotel records, this project aims to identify and analyze major risk factors contributing to cancellations, such as seasonal price hikes, lead time, and average daily rate. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can help optimize revenue strategies and reduce cancellation rates, thereby enhancing overall revenue efficiency for the hotel.


### Questions Addressed 

-  What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
- How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better?
- How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

###  Analysis and Findings

### Questions Addressed 

-  What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
- How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better?
- How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

###  Analysis and Findings

- The accompanying bar graph shows number of reservations that are canceled and those that are not. Below it is a pie chart which shows the percentage distribution. It is obvious that there are still a significant number of reservations that have not been canceled. There are still 37% of clients who canceled their reservation, which has a significant impact on the hotels' earnings.

- In comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings. It's possible that resort hotels are more expensive than those in cities.

- We can find that most number of bookings are transient reservations which may include walk-ins, online reservation or phone reservation.

- We have developed the grouped bar graph to analyze the months with the highest and lowest reservation levels according to reservation status. As can be seen, most number of uncancelled bookings are in August and most number of cancellations are in January.

- The line graph below shows that, on certain days, the average daily rate for a city hotel is less than that of a resort hotel, and on other days, it is even less. It goes without saying that weekends and holidays may see a rise in resort hotel rates.

- Most number of bookings have no deposits.

- This chart below shows that there is no relation between lead time and cancellation rates.

- As seen in the graph, reservations are canceled when the average daily rate is higher than when it is not canceled. It clearly proves all the above analysis, that the higher price leads to higher cancellation.

###  Suggestions
- Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.
- As the ratio of the cancelled to not cancelled of the city hotel is higher than the resort hotels, so the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices or attractive offers (like complementary meals/buffet) which would attract more customers.
- In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.
- They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
